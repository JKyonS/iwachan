# Iwachan
Script to play videos from Iwara without the embedded player

This script is based on the tv-player script before the site updated to it's now Iwara design/state.

Make the script executable and place it in either your $HOME/bin or $PATH.

### Requirements:
	- mpv with networking support(ffmpeg with networking)
	- everything else should be on a default GNU/Linux install

### Uses:
	
If the script is in your current directory:
	- ./iwachan URL
	- ./iwachan -d URL
	- ./iwachan -h
If the script is in your $PATH:
	- iwachan URL
	- iwachan -d URL
	- iwachan -h

### Errors:

Currently, the script will probably not give you much information if something goes wrong.

### To-Do:
I'm not entirely sure of how the site functions yet. There is bound to be some errors when trying to run the script. I will get around to fixing these later on as I find them.

Any comments, questions, or jokes are appreciated.
